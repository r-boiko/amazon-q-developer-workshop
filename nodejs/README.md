# QWords Node.js Application

This is a Wordle-like game application implemented using Express.js.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

To install the application dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Building the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npm start
```

The application will start and be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

npm test
```

This will run all tests using Jest.
