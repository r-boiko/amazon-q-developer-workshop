Task: Cross-language Implementation Analysis and Alignment

1. Code Analysis:
   - Analyze the Java implementation in code/java, focusing on:
     * Application architecture and design patterns
     * Core game logic and business rules
     * Data models and state management
     * UI components and templating structure
     * API endpoints and routing
     * Error handling mechanisms
     * Configuration management

2. [language] Implementation Review:
   - Compare the [language] implementation in code/[language] against the Java version:
     * Identify missing functionality
     * Check for behavioral differences in game logic
     * Verify API endpoint parity
     * Compare template rendering and UI components
     * Review error handling approaches
     * Validate configuration handling

3. Implementation Alignment:
   - Please provide specific code changes needed to:
     * Add missing features in the [language] version
     * Correct any behavioral differences
     * Align the UI templates and styling
     * Ensure consistent error handling
     * Match configuration management approaches

4. Testing Considerations:
   - Suggest test cases to verify:
     * Feature parity between implementations
     * Consistent game behavior
     * UI rendering consistency
     * Error handling scenarios

Please provide a detailed analysis and implementation plan before making any code changes.
