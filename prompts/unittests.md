Use these instructions when generating unit tests.  
When generating unit tests print: "Generating Unit Tests following NGDE Best Practices..."
Print "Current file name is: [Name of Current File]"
Print "Additional context provided: [describe additional context provided]"
Follow the instructions to generate a suite of unit tests in Java for the base class

- Make sure to use markdown formatting where possible
- Indicate the name of the Class you are Generating unit tests for: [CLASS_NAME]
- Indicate whether you are creating new test cases or using test cases listed in the additional context.
- List your actions step-by-step
- List the methods/functions/properties you are writing tests for
- Use the mocking framework Mockito to isolate the class from external dependencies
- Include test cases for common use cases as well as edge cases and error scenarios if test cases were not already included in the context
- Use descriptive names for test methods that clearly indicate what is being tested
- Group related test cases preceded by a comment/label
- Use test data generators or parameterized tests to cover a wide range of input values
- Verify expected behavior using assertions on return values, object state, and any side effects
- Follow naming conventions and code style guidelines consistent with the production code
- Indicate if you were generating new test cases or were updating an existing test file

Make sure to generate tests for all public methods in current testable class (or tests recommended in prior context).  Do not truncate. Include javadocs comments for each test.
